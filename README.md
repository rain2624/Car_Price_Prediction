# Car_Price_Prediction
This Project is related to prediction of car price with the use of Linear Regression Algorithm and Lasso Regression Algorithm.
The dataset is from kaggle (Vehicle dataset) - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho
This dataset contains information about used cars.
This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.
The columns in the given dataset are as follows:

1. name - Car Brands.
2. year - year in which car was bought.
3. selling_price - selling price of the car.
4. km_driven - number of kilometers the car is driven.
